# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Virtual Wardrobe is an intelligent wardrobe management system that leverages Google Gemini AI to provide virtual try-on capabilities, style recommendations, and clothing generation. The application allows users to upload their photos to create virtual models, manage their digital closet, and visualize different outfit combinations in real-time with AI-generated backgrounds and styling suggestions.

The system operates in two modes: a basic mode for quick AI-generated outfit recommendations, and an advanced mode for detailed wardrobe management and custom outfit visualization.
